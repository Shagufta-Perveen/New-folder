Heart Disease Prediction Model Performance

This repository contains the results of a comparative analysis of several machine learning models applied to the heart-disease-uci dataset.  We evaluated the performance of 
Logistic Regression
Random Forest
Support Vector Machine (SVM)
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
Gradient Boosting
Decision Tree
and Naive Bayes classifiers.
Key metrics used for evaluation include accuracy, recall, precision, and F1-score. 


Our findings indicate that the Random Forest model achieved the highest performance, boasting an accuracy of 0.8478, recall of 0.8334, precision of 0.8097, and an F1-score of 0.8200.  Other models also demonstrated competitive performance, with Gradient Boosting and Logistic Regression notably achieving strong results.  This project provides a comprehensive overview of model selection and evaluation for heart disease prediction using the UCI dataset.
